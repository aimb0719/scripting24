    <p>Powerpuff Girls is an American animated television series about three kindergarten-aged girls named Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup who possess superpowers. They live in a fictional city called Townsville. Professor Utonium, who they refer to as the girls’ father, created them in his lab while trying to make the perfect little girls but he accidentally mixed a mystery ingredient called Chemical X that gave the little girls superhuman powers. That also resulted in the three sisters having abnormally large eyes with short and thick arms and legs and round heads that looked like powder puffs. They are usually called upon by the mayor of Townsville city where they use their special set of superpowers to fight against crime from the nasty villains in their city and save the world from the forces of evil.</p>
